<h1>The Best Movies According to Kingsley</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Avatar the last airbender</h3>
<p>
    A beautiful animation with a simple colorful world and compelling stories.<br />
    This is my best animated movie or series.
</p>
<h3>Godzilla Vs Kong</h3>
<P>
    I always loved Kaiju movies, and this so far has been the best out of the bunch.<br />
    It might be second best soon though, judging by the trailers of "Godzilla X Kong: The new empire".
</P>
<h3>Avengers Infinity War and Endgame</h3>
<p>
    Yeah, i like superhero movies, but it has to have meaningful stories, a good CGI,<br />
    and it should be able to make the audience emotional, and Avengers Infinity War and Endgame ticks all these criterias.
